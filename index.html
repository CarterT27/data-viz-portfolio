    <h1>Carter Tran</h1>
    <p>I'm a student studying Data Science at the University of California San Diego. This summer I will be interning at Amazon as a Software Development Engineering Intern. My current research lies at the intersection of Transformer models and their applications to real-time seizure detection.</p>
